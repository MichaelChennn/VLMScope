    "description": "A medium shot captures an art class in a bright room with large windows. A woman, likely an instructor, dressed in a blue jumpsuit, stands next to a young African American man seated at an easel. He is painting an abstract piece with an orange and purple motif on a blue background. The instructor leans in, pointing to his canvas and offering guidance. She then moves away to interact with another student who is partially visible at a separate easel. The young man continues to paint diligently, focused on his artwork.",
